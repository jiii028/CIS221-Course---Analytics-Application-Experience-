**🎓 CIS221 — Analytics Application Experience**

This repository contains the files I worked on during my Analytics Application course. It showcases my knowledge and skills in Business Analytics through a series of mini-projects. It also includes sample notebooks and practice exercises that supported my learning throughout the course.

## **📊 3.1 — Challenges I Experienced in EDA, Inferential Regression, and ML Regression** 
  
  Throughout the course, I faced several challenges while working through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning.
  One major difficulty was interpreting and understanding results. Even when I correctly generated descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, or regression outputs, I sometimes struggled to translate those findings into meaningful insights or connect them to real business contexts.
  In inferential regression, I occasionally struggled (it was sometimes confusing) to clearly understand concepts like p-values, confidence intervals, normality, and statistical significance. I knew how to compute them, but coding and proper interpretation of these metrics in a meaningful way took time and practice.
  Regression for machine learning presented an even bigger challenge. The workflow felt more complex and less predictable especially when tuning hyperparameters, comparing models, or evaluating performance metrics. There were moments when I felt lost or overwhelmed by the fast pace and technical depth, making it difficult to fully keep up.

## **❓ 3.2. What could have been the reasons why such an event happened? (you could bring in some theory into it). What are the things we have learned so that we can improve from this experience?**

  There are several reasons why these difficulties occurred. First, coding and statistical reasoning both demand significant cognitive effort. According to cognitive load theory, when multiple new skills are learned at once, the brain can feel overloaded. In this course, I had to understand the code, remember the syntax, interpret the output, and apply analytical reasoning—all at the same time. This naturally made certain tasks feel overwhelming and sometimes too much for my brain to handle. Second, data analysis concepts depend on one another. Without a good understanding of statistics, concepts like regression coefficients, multicollinearity, or model error terms can seem complex. I probably struggled in part because I was still learning that fundamental information. Third, machine learning introduces a level of abstraction and experimentation that can feel less predictable. Unlike regular regression, where rules feel more structured, ML models require constant trial-and-error, tuning, and critical thinking. This can be intimidating and confusing when you’re still beginning to learn.

  However, despite these challenges, I gained valuable insights:
  * I learned that slowing down and revisiting my notes and notebooks makes advanced concepts easier.
  * I discovered the importance of reading documentation, continuous exploration with code, and validating assumptions rather than trying to rush through steps and depend solely on what we have covered in discussions.
  * I became more aware that analysis is not just about generating outputs but interpreting and understanding the story the data is telling.
  * Most importantly, I believe and have learned that struggling is part of the learning process, and each challenge builds competence, strength, and confidence.

## **✔️ 3.3. Now what do I need to do to be better next time?**
  To continue improving, I identified several steps that will help strengthen my skills:
  * Strengthen foundational knowledge in statistics and regression so that advanced concepts feel more intuitive.
  * Practice interpreting outputs more often, not just coding them, focusing on the “why” or WH reason behind the results.
  * Break tasks into smaller steps to reduce overwhelm and avoid cognitive overload. One step at a time and not rushing to absorb everything in a single time.
  * Practice coding regularly, even through small practice exercises, to build muscle memory and confidence.
  * Explore additional resources such as tutorials, documentation, and visual explainers to reinforce learning.
    Overall, this experience showed me that growth happens through continuous learning and patient practice. Every challenge I faced helped me become more confident and capable in data analytics and machine learning.
