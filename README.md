# CIS221-Course---Analytics-Application-Experience-
This repository contains files I have worked on during my Analytics Application Course. It highlights my knowledge and skills on business analytics reflected in these mini-projects.

* 3.1. What are the challenges I experienced in doing Exploratory Data Analysis, Inferential Regression Analysis, and Regression for Machine Learning?

* 3.2. What could have been the reasons why such an event happened? (you could bring in some theory into it). What are the things we have learned so that we can improve from this experience?

* 3.3. Now what do I need to do to be better next time?
